# HW4-Code-Quiz

## Description

As a programming student, it is important to apply newly learned skills in Web APIs and combining HTML, CSS, and JS to form a clean, user friendly application.  This can help test my skills, store my, and other classmates' scores and encourage me to beat those scores.  This exposure will help prepare me for possible coding assessments during interviews in the future.
