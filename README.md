# HW4-Code-Quiz

## Description

As a programming student, it is important to apply newly learned skills in Web APIs and combining HTML, CSS, and JS to form a clean, user friendly application.  This can help test my skills, store my, and other classmates' scores and encourage me to beat those scores.  This exposure will help prepare me for possible coding assessments during interviews in the future. 


## Usage

Once the live link is clicked on it will take you to the main page of the quiz that displays the intructions as well as the start button to begin.  When the quiz begins the timer will start and you will have a set amount of time to answer all the questions.  There will be 4 potential choices to select and 1 out of those will be the correct answer.  If the question is answered correct points will be earned, if it is incorrect time will be deducted from the timer.  When all questions have been answered or the time runs out, your score will be displayed and you will be able to submit your initials and score to be stored in our list of high scores.  You can follow the link to the high scores to view past scores and compare.
